### Important
- Before creating a new issue please make sure you have the latest release version or the latest compiled version if you're compiling the app your self.
- Include the app version.
- Include the full stacktrace.
- I do not issue setup installers for every release, so if you're having a problem with a previous version try compiling the app you self first.
